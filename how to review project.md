### Peer Review

Giving feedback to other students is rewarding both for them and for you. By looking at other people's code, you'll learn different approaches to programming. You'll also learn a valuable skill: how to look at and comment on code. Your review is also valuable for the student whose project you're reviewing. You'll be able to help them solve problems and point them to solutions to make their projects better.

### What makes a review helpful and effective?

- Be specific
- Point to solutions, but don't give away the answers.
- Be positive


### Review Etiquette


When it comes to constructive feedback, the tone and attitude you use to convey the feedback is a crucial part of an effective review. Remember, just like you, your peers have spent hours on these projects, so don’t forget to tell them what they’ve done well! Always strive to present your feedback in a positive, encouraging, and supportive way.


### Four questions to answer in your peer review



1- Does the project meet the grading requirements? If not, what’s missing?

2- What does the project do well?

3- Where does the project need improvement?

4- What are some resources you could share?
